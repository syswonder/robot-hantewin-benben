# mid360_imu_rbnx

Robonix package owning the `primitive/imu/*` namespace for the Ranger Mini's MID-360 embedded IMU. The IMU stream itself is produced by the upstream `livox_ros_driver2` launch (spawned by [`mid360_lidar_rbnx`](https://github.com/syswonder/primitive-livox-mid360-lidar-rbnx)) and published on `/livox/imu`. **This package does NOT spawn any ROS process** — it's a pure topic shim that atlas-registers the existing topic.

The split exists because robonix's invariant is "one primitive namespace = one package". Mixing `primitive/lidar/*` and `primitive/imu/*` in the same package would let two namespaces share one capability_id, breaking that rule.

## Capability surface

| Contract                       | Mode      | Transport | Source / handler                            |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `robonix/primitive/imu/driver` | rpc       | gRPC      | `Driver(CMD_INIT, config_json)` — lifecycle |
| `robonix/primitive/imu/imu`    | topic_out | ROS 2     | `/livox/imu` (sensor_msgs/Imu)              |

## Driver-init lifecycle

`start.sh` brings up the atlas bridge. The bridge opens a gRPC server (default port 50233), registers the capability and declares only `primitive/imu/driver` on atlas, then blocks awaiting `Driver(CMD_INIT, config_json)`.

When `rbnx boot` calls Init, the handler subscribes to the configured IMU topic and waits for the first `sensor_msgs/Imu` message — that's the sentinel proving the upstream livox driver is alive on this host's DDS bus. Once it arrives, we declare `primitive/imu/imu` on atlas and return ok.

## Boot ordering — defer, no dep graph

Robonix doesn't track package startup dependencies. The deploy manifest is an unordered list. Instead, packages defer themselves at runtime: if `mid360_lidar_rbnx`'s Init hasn't completed yet, `/livox/imu` is silent. Our Init does a short probe (default 2 s), and on miss falls back to the full sentinel timeout (default 30 s). When `rbnx-cli` grows defer-queue handling, this falls back to returning `Driver_Response(state="deferred")` after the short probe so the boot loop retries us out-of-band.

This pattern is intentionally simpler than a topological dep graph: each package only declares what it needs at the moment its Init runs, so there's no manifest-drift problem when contracts change shape.

## Config (passed via `Driver(CMD_INIT, config_json)`)

```json
{
  "imu_topic":          "/livox/imu",
  "defer_probe_s":      2.0,
  "sentinel_timeout_s": 30.0
}
```
